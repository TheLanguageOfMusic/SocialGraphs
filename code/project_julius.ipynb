At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing allegations of an [[illegal marriage]] with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].nnAaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'', which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \"[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]\". The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this goal. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her role in ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', and released, in 2001, her [[Aaliyah (album)|self-titled third and final studio album]], which topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].nnOn August 25, 2001, Aaliyah died at the age of 22 in an [[2001 Marsh Harbour Cessna 402 crash|airplane accident in the Bahamas]], when the badly overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his body, and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. In the decades since her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases, and she has sold an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. [[List of awards and nominations received by Aaliyah|Her accolades]] include three [[American Music Awards]] and two [[MTV VMAs]], along with five [[Grammy Award]] nominations. ''Billboard'' lists her as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history.nn==Early life==nAaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York,<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44722|pure_url=yes}}|title=Aaliyah Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 8, 2008}}</ref> and was the younger child of Diane and Michael \"Miguel\" Haughton (1951u20132012).<ref name=s1 /> She was of [[African-American]] descent.<ref name=s1>{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=1|Ref=none}}</ref><ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/08/27/welbekin.cnna/index.html |title=Vibe Magazine's Emil Wilbekin: Remembering Aaliyah |date=August 27, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=May 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616164855/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/08/27/welbekin.cnna/index.html |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"aali\">{{cite web |last1=Ali |first1=Rasha |title=Aaliyah's 'Queen of the Damned' 15th Anniversary: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Vampire Thriller |url=https://www.thewrap.com/aaliyahs-queen-of-the-damned-15th-anniversary-10-things-you-didnt-know/ |website=The Wrap |access-date=March 13, 2019 |date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Her name is the feminine form of the [[Arabic]] \"[[Ali (name)|Ali]]\" meaning \"highest, most exalted one, the best.\"<ref name=Sutherland2>Sutherland 2005, 2u20134.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Farley|first=Christopher John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwlBoSSahkYC&q=%22very+proud+of+it%22+aaliyah&pg=PA20|title=Aaliyah: More Than a Woman|date=January 26, 2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7434-5566-4|language=en}}</ref> The singer was highly fond of her name, calling it \"beautiful\" and asserting she was \"very proud of it\" and strove to live up to her name every day.<ref name=Sutherland2 /> Aaliyah's mother enrolled Aaliyah in voice lessons at an early age.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> She started performing at weddings, church choir and charity events.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=9|Ref=Sutherland}}</ref> When Aaliyah was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was raised along with her older brother, [[Rashad Haughton|Rashad]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kenyatta|2002|p=3|Ref=Kenyatta}}</ref><ref name=\"AMG rock\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|author2=Woodstra, Chris |author3=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide to Rock|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2002|page=1|isbn=0-87930-653-X}}</ref> She attended a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]],'' which inspired her to become an entertainer.<ref name=\"Farley22-23\" /> In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law [[Barry Hankerson]]'s widening interests.

She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: \"I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.\" She did this in her own life, as she planned to \"fall back on\" another part of the entertainment industry.

They released their first single in 1994, \"[[Silver Shadow (song)#All Saints 1.9.7.5. version|Silver Shadow]]\", but it only peaked in the lower regions of the charts. Additionally, Rainford was not getting along very well with the other girls, and subsequently left the group in 1995. After one more release, the remaining duo was dropped by ZTT Records.<ref name=fortune/>nnRegardless, Blatt and Lewis set out to find a replacement for Rainford. Conducting many auditions, Blatt's father, a taxi driver at the time, met [[Nicole Appleton]] in May 1996 whom Blatt knew from her days at the [[Sylvia Young Theatre School]]. However, Blatt was too embarrassed to ask Appleton to join the band, so she left it to the normally shy Lewis to ask her. \"We gave her the low-down on everything and played her some demos, which she loved\", she said. \"She sang to me in the bathroom of a restaurant and we knew right away she'd be perfect. I was like, 'Cool! She can join!' And that was that\".<ref name=fortune/> Nicole's older sister, [[Natalie Appleton]], at first pondered with the idea of becoming the band's manager. However, it seemed natural that she should be a part of it, according to Lewis. Natalie had to be persuaded to join the band, because she did not want to leave her daughter Rachel whilst she was overseas. Then, her parents stepped in and offered to look after their granddaughter for her.<ref name=fortune/>nn===1996u20131999: ''All Saints''===n{{Main|All Saints (All Saints album)}}nAfter forming a new group in May 1996, the four singers met with [[Karl Gordon|Karl \"K-Gee\" Gordon]], a former band member of [[Outlaw Posse]].

The album ''All Saints'' was released in October 1997, reached number two on the [[UK Album Chart]], and was BPI-certified five times platinum in the UK for sales of 1.5&nbsp;million.

Afterwards, his family relocated to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where he became a member of Christ Temple Baptist Church. While there, he sang with a group called the Hammond Singers (named after the founding minister, James Hammond). Later, Nickolas attended and graduated from [[Willow Run High School]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], before pursuing his professional career, where he would ultimately meet his wife, Valerie. They met at [[Harlem]]'s White Rock Baptist Church in 1964. After having recorded unsuccessfully as a duo, they joined an aspiring solo artist and former member of the [[Ikettes]], [[Jo Armstead|Joshie Jo Armstead]], at the Scepter/Wand label, where their compositions were recorded by [[Ronnie Milsap]] (\"Never Had It So Good\"), [[Maxine Brown (soul singer)|Maxine Brown]] (\"One Step at a Time\"), as well as the [[Shirelles]] and [[Chuck Jackson]]. Another of the trio's songs, \"[[Let's Go Get Stoned (Ray Charles song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]],\" gave [[Ray Charles]] a number one U.S. R&B hit in 1966. That same year, Ashford & Simpson joined [[Motown]], where their best-known songs included \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]],\" \"[[You're All I Need to Get By]],\" \"[[Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing]],\" and \"[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)]].\" Ashford and Simpson wrote many other hit songs, including [[Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\" (1978) and \"Is It Still Good to Ya?\", originally recorded by the duo in 1978 and covered by [[Teddy Pendergrass]] in 1980.nnAs performers, Ashford & Simpson's best-known duets are \"[[Solid (song)|Solid]]\" (1984) and \"[[Found a Cure (Ashford & Simpson song)|Found a Cure]]\" (1979). The duo were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2002.

They started their career in the mid-1960s, writing for artists such as [[the 5th Dimension]] (\"[[California Soul]]\"), [[Aretha Franklin]] (\"Cry Like A Baby\"), and [[Ray Charles]] (\"[[Let's Go Get Stoned (R&B song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]]\" and \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\").<ref name=\"LarkinSM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=9/10}}</ref> Their work with Charles brought them to the attention of [[Motown]] chief [[Berry Gordy]].<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>nnUpon joining the Motown staff in 1966, Ashford & Simpson were paired with the vocal duo [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], and they wrote and/or produced all but one of the late-1960s Gaye/Terrell singles, including hits such as the original version of \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\", \"[[Your Precious Love]]\", \"[[Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing]]\", and \"[[You're All I Need to Get By]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> According to Gaye in the book ''Divided Soul'', Simpson did most of the vocals on the last album he did with Terrell, ''[[Easy (Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell album)|Easy]]'', as a way for Terrell's family to have additional income, as she was battling an ultimately fatal brain tumor. Though Louvain Demps, singer of [[the Andantes]], has stated that she saw Terrell recording the album, and Simpson is quoted as saying, in a book written by Terrell's sister, Ludie Montgomery, what they saw was her singing the guide tracks for the album, which were later replaced by Tammi's own vocals.nnAshford & Simpson wrote and produced almost all the songs on three 1970s albums for former [[The Supremes|Supreme]] [[Diana Ross]], including her first solo album ''[[Diana Ross (1970 album)|Diana Ross]]'' (\"[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)]]\")<ref>George-Warren, Holly and Patricia Romanowski.

The LP contains their vocals and also four Ashford compositions. In 1964, they recorded \"I'll Find You\", as \"Valerie & Nick\". That was followed by several obscure singles recorded by Ashford on the Glover, [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[ABC Records|ABC]] labels, such as \"It Ain't Like That\" (later recorded by [[Martha Reeves & The Vandellas|Martha Reeves & the Vandellas]]), \"[[California Soul]]\", and \"[[Dead End Kids]]\", backed by his own version of \"[[Let's Go Get Stoned (R&B song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]]\".nnSimpson appeared (with [[Melba Moore]]) as part of the \"[[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] Soul Chorus\" on the band's debut album ''[[Child Is Father to the Man]]'' in 1968. After concentrating on working with other artists, Simpson was the featured soloist on the songs \"[[Bridge Over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge Over Troubled Water]]\" and \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\" on the [[Quincy Jones]] albums ''Gula Matari'' in 1970, and its follow-up, ''Smackwater Jack''.nnSimpson subsequently recorded two solo LPs for [[Motown]]: ''Exposed'' in 1971, and, the following year, ''Valerie Simpson'', which included the single \"Silly, Wasn't I\", which was later sampled on [[50 Cent]]'s \"[[Best Friend (50 Cent song)|Best Friend]]\" from the movie, ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''. The song was also sampled by [[9th Wonder]] on [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]]'s \"Silly Girl\" in the album, ''[[Murray's Revenge]]''. Ashford & Simpson were featured singing selections from Simpson's solo albums on the [[PBS]] TV show ''[[Soul!]]'', hosted by Ellis Haizlip in 1971. In 1973, they left Motown after the albums Simpson recorded for the label received poor promotion, and the company refused to release an album of the duo recording a collection of their most famous songs for other artists.nnIn 1974, Ashford and Simpson married after resuming their career as a duo,<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> with the [[Warner Bros.]] album ''Gimme Something Real'' released in 1973, followed in 1974 by ''I Wanna Be Selfish''. In 1975, Simpson sang backing vocals on [[Paul Simon|Paul Simon's]] [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1976|number-one hit]] \"[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]\", and in 1976 they released ''Come As You Are''. 1977 saw the release of two albums u2013 ''So So Satisfied'' and ''Send it''. This was followed by the hit singles \"Send It\", \"Don't Cost You Nothin'\" (1977), \"It Seems To Hang On\" (1978), \"Is It Still Good To Ya\" (1978), \"Found a Cure\" (1979), \"Street Corner\" (1982), and their biggest hit, \"[[Solid (song)|Solid]]\", released in 1984.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>nnIn 1978, they were featured as vocalists, along with [[Chaka Khan]], on the hit single \"[[Stuff Like That]]\" from [[Quincy Jones]]' ''Sounds... And Stuff Like That'' album and contributed to the writing of the soundtrack to ''[[The Wiz]]''. The duo appeared as themselves in \"Nocturne\", a 1986 episode of the popular television series ''[[The Equalizer]]''.nnOn his own, Ashford (along with [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]]) produced the hit \"[[I'm Gonna Make You Love Me]]\", which [[Diana Ross & the Supremes]] recorded in collaboration with [[the Temptations]] in 1968. He also appeared in the movie ''[[New Jack City]]'' (1991), as Reverend Oates, an ordained minister who was part of Nino Brown's entourage.nnSimpson's brothers were in the record business as well: [[Ray Simpson]] replaced [[Victor Willis]] in [[Village People|the Village People]] and their brother Jimmy Simpson produced the group [[GQ (band)|GQ]] (which had big hits with \"[[Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)]]\" and \"I Do Love You\"), and was in great demand as a mixing engineer during the [[disco]] era.nn===Recent years and Ashford's death===nIn latter times, Ashford & Simpson recorded and toured sporadically, and in 1996, they opened a restaurant and live entertainment [[Music venue|venue]], Sugar Bar in New York City, with an [[open mic]] on Thursday nights, where performers included [[Queen Latifah]], [[Vickie Natale]] and [[Felicia Collins]].

On June 22, 2009, they made a guest performance at a party at Tribeca Rooftop, New York, to celebrate [[Virgin Atlantic]]'s birthday party.

During [[Marques Houston]]'s 18th birthday party that Chris Stokes was hosting in 1999, [[Omarion]] joined the group. They named their group B2K to represent the fact that they got together in the beginning of the year 2000, which was also considered the [[Year 2000 problem|''\"Y2K\"'']] era, in turn they considered themselves ''\"Boys of the New Millennium\"'' and acronym it ''B2K''. They made a cameo in [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Lil' Bow Wow]]'s video for \"[[Ghetto Girls]]\", and were the opening act on the Scream Tour I. They also appeared in IMx's video for Clap Your Hands.nnB2K broke into the US pop charts in late 2001 with their single \"Uh Huh\". The group's debut album, ''[[B2K (album)|B2K]]'' was released on March 12, 2002. The album peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #1 on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] albums chart.nnTheir debut album included follow-up singles including \"[[Gots Ta Be]]\", which managed to break the top 40 by charting at #34. Their final single, \"Why I Love You\", was released in the spring, along with a music video that featured cameos from labelmates [[Jhene Aiko]] and [[Naya Rivera]]. Even though it had very little success on the Billboard 100, charting at #73, it entered the top 20 on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, charting at #19. The group's debut album was certified Gold in the summer. B2K also performed a concert special for [[Nickelodeon]] in July of that year. They were also featured in the magazines ''Word Up'' and ''Right On'', along with other R&B artists. Each member was also given the lineal championship ship for the welterweight division from the u201cRing Magazineu201d  This in large part due to their incredible street credit and fierce defense of all ground they stood on.nn===2002u20132004: ''Pandemonium!'', ''You Got Served'' and split===nnAfter performing on the Scream Tour II with [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], [[Tom Gurl Four|TG4]] and [[IMx]], B2K released a Christmas album titled ''[[Santa Hooked Me Up]]''.

Two singles from the album, \"[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]\" and \"[[Do Me!]],\" both reached number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1990.  The band released three more albums, though none had the success of their debut. Their most recent album ''[[Three Stripes (album)|Three Stripes]]'' came out in 2017.nnDespite only producing four albums of original material in a 31-year span, the group has continuously toured and performed live, both as an act on their own and on several New Edition reunion tours.nn==History==nThe trio of [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]] has their origins as founders of the [[Boston]]-based quintet [[New Edition]], which had gained notice of famed producer [[Maurice Starr]] at a talent show in 1981, and as children had several hits with songs like \"[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]\" and \"[[Cool It Now]].\" Throughout the 1980s, the line-up changed and the group matured and sought to branch out in new musical directions.  During a hiatus in 1989, and at the suggestion of producers [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], the three decided to form a new group, and were signed by [[MCA Records]].<ref name=\"popdose\">Heyliger, Mike. \"Popdose Flashback u201990: Bell Biv DeVoe, Poison.\" Popdose.com.

Blige 1998.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Blige in 1998]]nOn April 22, 1997, MCA Records (parent company to Uptown Records, which was in the process of being dismantled) released Blige's third album, ''[[Share My World]]''. By then, she and Combs had dissolved their working relationship. In his place were the [[Trackmasters]], who executive-produced the project along with [[Steve Stoute]]. Sharing production duties were producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. The album was made at a time when Blige was trying to \"get her life together\", by trying to overcome drugs and alcohol, as well as the ending of her relationship with Hailey. After an encounter with a person who threatened her life the previous year, she tried to quit the unhealthy lifestyle and make more upbeat, happier music. As a result, songs such as \"Love Is All We Need\" and \"Share My World\" were made.<!--give source for this info per MoS--> ''Share My World'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned five hit singles: \"Love Is All We Need\" (featuring [[Nas]]), \"I Can Love You\" (featuring [[Lil' Kim]]), \"Everything\", \"Missing You\" (UK only) and \"Seven Days\" (featuring [[George Benson]]). In February 1997, Blige performed her hit at the time, \"[[Not Gon' Cry]]\", at the [[1997 Grammy Awards]], which gained her a third Grammy Award nomination, her first for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]], as Blige was recording the follow-up to ''My Life''. In early 1998, Blige won an American Music Award for \"Favorite Soul/R&B Album\". That summer, she embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certified [[live album]] released later that year, simply titled ''[[The Tour (album)|The Tour]]''. The album spawned one single, \"Misty Blue\".nnOn August 17, 1999, Blige's fourth album, titled ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' was released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]-tinged collection of songs, reminiscent of the 1970s to early 1980s soul. She also appeared on ''[[In Concert: A Benefit for the Crossroads Centre at Antigua]]'' with [[Eric Clapton]] in 1999. On December 14, 1999, the album was re-released as a double-disc set. The second disc was enhanced with the music videos for the singles \"All That I Can Say\" and \"Deep Inside\" and included two bonus tracks: \"Sincerity\" (featuring [[Nas]], Andy Hogan and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]) and \"Confrontation\" (a collaboration with hip hop duo [[Funkmaster Flex]] & [[Big Kap]] originally from their 1999 album ''The Tunnel''). The ''Mary'' album was critically praised, becoming her most nominated release to date, and was certified double platinum. It was not as commercially successful as Blige's prior releases, though all of the singles: \"All That I Can Say\", \"Deep Inside\", \"Your Child\", and \"Give Me You\" performed considerably on the radio. In the meantime, MCA used the album to expand Blige's demographic into the nightclub market, as club-friendly [[dance music|dance]] [[remix]]es of the ''Mary'' singles were released. The club remix of \"Your Child\" peaked at number-one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in October 2000. In 2001, a Japan-only compilation, ''[[Ballads (Mary J. Blige album)|Ballads]]'', was released. The album featured covers of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"Overjoyed\", and previous recordings of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]\" and [[Dorothy Moore]]'s \"[[Misty Blue]]\". In 1999, [[George Michael]] and Mary J. Blige covered the song 'As' written by Stevie Wonder, and worldwide outside of the United States, it was the second single from George Michael's greatest hits album ''[[Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael]]''. It became a top ten UK pop hit, reaching number four on the chart. It was not released on the U.S. version of the greatest hits collection or as a single in the U.S. Michael cited Blige's record company president for pulling the track in America after Michael's arrest for committing a lewd act.nnIn January 2001, Blige performed as a special guest in the [[Super Bowl XXXV halftime show]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The most memorable Super Bowl halftime shows |url=https://ew.com/gallery/super-bowl-memorable-halftime-shows/?slide=421911#421911 |website=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly  |access-date=1 December 2020 |language=EN |date=2 February 2009}}</ref>nn===2001u201304: ''No More Drama'' and ''Love & Life''===n[[File:Mary j-02-mika.jpg|thumb|Blige in [[Hamburg]], Germany, 2000|alt=]]nnOn August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige's fifth studio album, ''[[No More Drama]]''. The album's first single, \"[[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|Family Affair]]\" (produced by [[Dr. Dre]]) became her first and only number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. It was followed by two further hit singles, the European only single \"[[Dance for Me (Mary J. Blige song)|Dance for Me]]\" featuring [[Common (rapper)|Common]] with samples from \"[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]]\" by [[The Police]], and the [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]-produced [[No More Drama (song)|title track]] (originally recorded for the ''Mary'' album), which sampled \"[[Nadia's Theme]]\", the piano-driven theme song to the daytime drama ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. Though the album sold nearly two million copies in the U.S., MCA was underwhelmed by its sales, and subsequently repackaged and re-released the album on January 29, 2002. The ''No More Drama'' re-release featured a new album cover, deleted three of the songs from the original tracklisting, while adding two brand-new songsu2014one of which was the fourth single and top twenty Hot 100 hit \"[[Rainy Dayz]]\", (featuring [[Ja Rule]]), plus two remixes; one of the title track, serviced by Sean Combs/Puff Daddy and the single version of \"Dance for Me\" featuring Common. Blige won a Grammy for '[[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]' for the song \"He Think I Don't Know.\" In April 2002, Blige performed with [[Shakira]] with the song \"[[Love Is a Battlefield]]\" on [[VH1 Divas]] show live in Las Vegas, she also performed \"[[No More Drama (song)|No More Drama]]\" and \"[[Rainy Dayz]]\" as a duet with the returning [[Whitney Houston]].nnOn July 22, 2002, MCA released ''[[Dance for Me (album)|Dance for Me]]'', a collection of club remixes of some of her past top hits including the [[Junior Vasquez]] remix of \"Your Child\", and the [[Thunderpuss]] mix of \"No More Drama.\" This album was released in a limited edition double pack 12\" vinyl for DJ-friendly play in nightclubs.nnOn August 26, 2003, Blige's sixth album ''[[Love & Life (Mary J. Blige album)|Love & Life]]'' was released on [[Geffen Records]] (which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige heavily collaborated with her one-time producer Sean Combs for this set. Due to the history between them on ''What's the 411?'' and ''My Life'', which is generally regarded as their best work, and Blige having just come off of a successful fifth album, expectations were high for the reunion effort.nnDespite the album debuting at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and becoming Blige's fourth consecutive UK top ten album, ''Love & Life''{{'}}s lead-off single, the Diddy-produced \"[[Love @ 1st Sight]]\", which featured Method Man, barely cracked the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the top twenty on the Hot 100 (although peaking inside the UK top twenty). The following singles, \"[[Ooh!]]\", \"[[Not Today (Mary J. Blige song)|Not Today]]\" featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], \"[[Whenever I Say Your Name]]\" featuring [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the international re-release, and \"[[It's a Wrap]]\" fared worse. Although the album was certified platinum, it became Blige's lowest-selling at the time. Critics and fans alike largely panned the disc, citing a lack of consistency and noticeable ploys to recapture the early Blige/Combs glory. Blige and Combs reportedly struggled and clashed during the making of this album, and again parted ways upon the completion of it.<!--give source of this info per MoS-->nnThe album became Blige's first album in six years to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 285,298 copies in first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht859 |title=Previous Album Sales Chart |publisher=HITS Daily Double |access-date=February 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906112248/http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht859 |archive-date=September 6, 2013  }}</ref> ''Love & Life'' received mixed reviews from music critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/bligemaryj/loveandlife?q=Mary%20J.%20Blige |title=Mary J.

Founded in 1972, the group's original members included lead singer Ted Mills with Vernon Sawyer, Wendell Sawyer, Keith Beaton, and Calvin McFarland . Their most notable songs included smooth soul ballads such as \"[[Sideshow (song)|Sideshow]]\", \"Spell\", \"Whatu2019s Come Over Me\", \"Three Ring Circus\" and \"[[Stop to Start]]\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halliburton |first1=Karen |title=Blue Magic's Wendell Sawyer discusses the magic of the blue |url=https://50bold.com/blue-magics-wendell-sawyer-discusses-the-magic-of-the-blue/ |website=50BOLD |access-date=25 September 2020 |date=29 January 2020}}</ref>nn==Origins==nBlue Magic was formed in Philadelphia, [[Pennsylvania]] in 1972 when former member of [[The Delfonics]], [[Randy Cain]], brought in singer-songwriter Ted Mills to do some writing with the Philly-based WMOT production company to create a new band. A short time later the group [[Shades of Love (band)|Shades of Love]], featuring Keith Beaton, Richard Pratt, Vernon Sawyer and his brother Wendell, came in to audition. (According to Marc Taylor in his book ''A Touch of Classic Soul of the Early 1970s'', \"although the group performed admirably, they lacked a standout lead singer\".) The execs decided to replace the Toppicks, the act Mills recorded with. They inserted Shades of Love (which they owned contractually) with Ted Mills and retitled the group Blue Magic. They were signed with Atco Records through WMOT in the same year.nn==Recording, early singles, and their first album==nThe group was one of the earliest acts produced by [[Norman Harris (musician)|Norman Harris]], a Philadelphia recording veteran.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=23}}</ref> The group's harmonies were supported by the [[MFSB]] studio house band.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/> Their first early song release in 1973 was \"Spell\" which went onto the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] peaking at No. 30 (it was written and co-produced by Mills).

Their next single was the ballad \"Stop to Start\". This hit was even more successful, reaching number 14 on the Billboard R&B chart and number 74 on the pop chart.

The song \"What's Come Over Me\" from their debut album was re-worked as a duet with [[Margie Joseph]] dubbed in alongside Mills' original lead vocals. The new approach saw the song climb to number 11 on the R&B chart again in 1975. In total, the group had two R&B chart singles in 1975 and four in 1976.nnThe group had their first world tour that year which lasted for 42 weeks. The tour included 48 states in the United States, five countries in Europe and a 10-day stay in the Philippines. They concluded their tour with a two-week engagement in the Virgin Islands.nnBlue Magic were known also for their choreography. As a visually oriented group, they had several major television appearances, including ''[[Soul Train]],'' ''The Mike Douglas Show,'' ''The Jerry Blavat Show,'' ''Dancin' On Air,'' and ''A.M. Philadelphia.''nnIn April 1975, they were chosen as the best new group of the year which earned two [[Ebony Awards]]. The first was presented in [[New York City]] by [[Aretha Franklin]], the second in [[Florida]] by the female recording artist [[Vanity (singer)|Vanity]].nnThey have shared the stage with other performers such as [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[The Commodores]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[The Spinners (soul music)|The Spinners]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[New Edition]], [[The Stylistics]], [[Mick Jagger]] and others.nnThe group also contributed background vocals for [[Alyson Williams]] and the [[Rolling Stones]] (on the song \"If You Really Want To Be My Friend\" from the album ''[[It's Only Rock 'n' Roll]]'').nn==Decline in popularity==nBy 1977, the group's popularity had faded with the rise of [[disco]] and changing music styles, and despite the group continuing to record consistently they failed to chart. Subsequent label moves to [[Capitol Records]] for a reunion with Norman Harris (who had left two years earlier) and then the smaller label Mirage resulted in some smaller R&B charting, but no major success.<ref name=\"LarkinSM\"/>nn==The 1980s, disbanding, regrouping in the 1990s==nBackground singer Richard Pratt left in the early 1980s. After sibling singers Vernon and Wendell Sawyer left, the remaining two members Mills and Beaton hired two other singers and traveled to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to record with [[Skip Scarborough]] and some members of the popular group [[Earth Wind & Fire]] on the album ''[[Message from the Magic]]''.nnIn 1988, the original group got back together and had some renewed popularity in late 1989 with the album ''[[From Out of the Blue]]''. Also in 1989, they appeared on the song \"To Be Your Man\", the third single from [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s second album, ''[[It's a Big Daddy Thing]]''.nnIn 1990, ''[[The Amsterdam News]]'' carried the story of Mills' near-fatal car accident. After surgery in 1996, Mills returned to the music scene as a solo act, recording an album for [[Casablanca Records]] that year entitled ''[[This Magic Is Real]]'', featuring the remake of \"Tear It Down\". The other members of the group brought in new lead Rod Wayne (real name Roderick Bronaugh), who remained with the group until 2004. Bronaugh now teaches at [[Tennessee State University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnstate.edu/music/faculty/r_bronaugh.aspx |title=Roderick Bronaugh |website=Tnstate.edu |date= |access-date=2014-07-29}}</ref>nn==The 2000s and incidental work==nMills appeared in the touring play, ''Girl, He Ain't Worth It'' with [[The Manhattans]], [[Meli'sa Morgan]] and [[Tito Jackson]], and appeared in the play ''Looking For Love In All the Wrong Places''.

During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on [[Motown Records]] as a quartet including bass [[Michael McCary]], who left the group in 2003 due to back spasms that were eventually diagnosed as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/30/boyz-ii-men-fourth-member_n_6071200.html |title=Boyz II Men Dishes On Mike, Their Estranged Fourth Member |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=2014-10-30 }}</ref>nnDuring the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success.

Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of \"[[I'll Make Love to You]]\" and \"[[One Sweet Day]]\" (with [[Mariah Carey]]), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks, respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success.nnConsequently, Boyz II Men is among the music industry's elite with regard to time spent at number one in ''Billboard'' history with 50 cumulative weeks, ranking sixth behind [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[the Beatles]], [[Rihanna]], [[Elvis Presley]] and Carey.

This section of the street is near the High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, where the members once attended.nnnn== History ==n=== 1985u20131990: Beginnings ===nnThe group, originally known as Unique Attraction, was started by friends [[Nathan Morris]] and [[Marc Nelson]] at the [[Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts]] (CAPA)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Westover|first1=Jonas|title=Boyz II Men|journal=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|date=11 Feb 2013|volume=2nd Edition}}</ref> along with fellow schoolmates [[George Baldi]], Jon Shoats, and Marguerite Walker in 1985. In 1987, [[Wanya Morris]], who sang in the school's choir along with the members of Unique Attraction, joined the group and became a permanent member when he was only a freshman. In 1988 Baldi, Shoats, and Walker all left the group due to graduation. They then recruited [[Shawn Stockman]] after seeing him perform a solo in the school's choir. One day, Nate, Marc, Wanya and Shawn were practicing harmonies in a school bathroom and in walked [[Michael McCary]] who started singing along with the group and eventually became the group's new bass singer. Now with a permanent lineup of members, the group rehearsed in the high school's bathrooms, due to the excellent acoustics, and on the corners of their schools and local hangouts. They found inspiration in [[New Edition]]'s harmonies and routines, and eventually renamed the group \"Boyz II Men\", after one of New Edition's songs, \"Boys to Men\", from their 1988 album ''[[Heart Break]]''. After performing at a Valentine's Day party at school in 1989 they got their big break when they snuck into a concert put on by local radio station Power 99 at the [[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Philadelphia Civic Center]]. Their plan was to find [[Will Smith]] backstage and perform for him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stockman|first=Shawn|date=July 9, 2020|title=Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men on Ernie Ball Striking A Chord Live|url=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCb8-pjlsYo/|access-date=July 11, 2020|website=Ernie Ball on Instagram IGTV}}</ref> But while looking for Smith, they happened to cross paths with New Edition member [[Michael Bivins]], who along with fellow groupmates Ricky Bell and [[Ronnie DeVoe]] just announced they were forming a New Edition spin-off trio [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. After they sang New Edition's \"[[Can You Stand the Rain]]\" for him, Bivins and everyone in attendance including other celebrities were impressed. He then gave the group his number and told them to give him a call. Nate eventually called him, and he agreed to manage and helped produce the group.nnThe delay before recording their own material and reported personality conflicts led founding member Marc Nelson to leave the group, making Boyz II Men into the quartet that found international fame: Michael McCary, Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, and Shawn Stockman.nn=== 1991u20131992: ''Cooleyhighharmony'' and \"End of the Road\" ===nBoyz II Men's first album, ''[[Cooleyhighharmony]]'', was released on Motown in 1991 and was produced by Michael Bivins. ''Cooleyhighharmony''{{'}}s drum-heavy [[new jack swing]] sound and multi-layered [[sampling (music)|sampled]] backdrops were similar to that of [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s own work, but featured classic-soul styled vocals in place of BBD's [[rapping]] and brassier [[singing]]. This style was dubbed \"[[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[doo-wop]]\" by the group and Bivins, who presented Boyz II Men and adolescent R&B group [[Another Bad Creation]] to the public as BBD's protégés.nnFrom the beginning, Boyz II Men featured all four members as leads, avoiding the usual R&B group arrangement of one or two lead singers and a team of background singers. The multiple-lead arrangement became a Boyz II Men trademark, and it became typical to hear Wanya Morris' vibrato-heavy [[tenor]], Shawn Stockman's tenor voice, Nathan Morris' [[baritone]], and Michael McCary's [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] (often used in spoken-word sections of many Boyz II Men hits) trading bars in each song.nnThe album's liner notes identified unique nicknames for each member of the group. These nicknames were devised in collaboration with Bivins in an attempt at marketing. Wanya was \"Squirt\", Shawn was \"Slim\", Michael was simply \"Bass\", and Nathan assumed the name \"Alex Vanderpool\", after a soap opera character who brandished a nerdy style.<ref>The character in question, Alfred Vanderpool, appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[All My Children]]''.</ref>nnBoyz II Men's first single, the [[Dallas Austin]]-produced \"[[Motownphilly]]\" featured a rap cameo by Michael Bivins that gives the story of how he met Boyz II Men. The single's release was accompanied with a [[music video]] that presented the group in hip hop style. (The video also included cameos from fellow Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts alumni [[Black Thought]] and [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]].) ''Cooleyhighharmony''{{'}}s second single was an a cappella cover of a classic Motown tune, [[G.C. Cameron]]'s \"[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]\" from the 1975 film ''[[Cooley High]]'', while \"Uhh Ahh\" served as the third single.nn''Cooleyhighharmony'' achieved major success, eventually selling over nine million copies and winning the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1992|1992 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/arts/boyz-ii-men-at-the-head-of-the-class.html|last1=Rule|title=Boyz II Men at the Head of the Class|access-date=9 November 2017|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 9, 1994}}</ref> Boyz II Men were also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], along with British singer-songwriter [[Seal (singer)|Seal]], fellow R&B group [[Color Me Badd]], as well as dance group [[C+C Music Factory]], but the Grammy was awarded to singer-songwriter [[Marc Cohn]]. \"Motownphilly\" and \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" were number 1 R&B hits and top five U.S. pop hits.nnIn 1992, Boyz II Men joined [[MC Hammer]]'s high-profile ''2 Legit 2 Quit'' [[Concert tour#Concert tour|tour]] as an [[opening act]]. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in [[Chicago]], and the group's future performances of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" were dedicated to him.

This song, released as a single on June 30, 1992, became Boyz II Men's biggest hit. It reached the number one position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on August 15, remaining there for a record-setting 13 weeks, until November 14, 1992. The success of \"End of the Road\" instantly transformed Boyz II Men from up-and-coming R&B stars into mainstream music celebrities.nnA revamped ''Cooleyhighharmony'' was reissued during 1993, with \"End of the Road\" added as a special bonus track, but \"End of the Road\" initially appeared only on the ''Boomerang'' soundtrack. Later the track was included on a collection of singles produced by Michael Bivins called \"East Coast Family, Vol. 1\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006K52 |title=East Coast Family 1: Various Artists: Music |website=Amazon.com |access-date=2011-02-26}}</ref> Shortly after the release of this compilation, Boyz II Men and Michael Bivins parted ways professionally. Boyz II Men continued to work with Babyface and other high-profile record producers over the next several years.nn=== 1994: ''II'' and \"I'll Make Love to You\" ===n[[File:Boys II Men.jpg|thumb|Boyz II Men in 1995]]nAfter releasing a Christmas compilation, ''[[Christmas Interpretations]]'' in 1993, Boyz II Men returned to the studio for their highly anticipated sophomore effort. In 1994, ''[[II (Boyz II Men album)|II]]'' was released. ''II'' sold more than {{Nowrap|12 million}} copies in the United States alone, becoming one of the best-selling albums ever released by an R&B group act, and one of the biggest albums of the decade. ''II'' later won two awards at the [[37th Grammy Awards|1995 Grammy Awards]] including [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]].nnMost of the tracks on ''II'' were written and produced by [[Tim & Bob]]u2014Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson (5), Babyface (2) and the successful team of [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] (2). Several of ''II''{{'}}s tracks became major singles, among them Jam & Lewis's \"On Bended Knee\", and Babyface's \"[[I'll Make Love to You]]\" and \"[[Water Runs Dry]]\".nn\"I'll Make Love to You\" broke \"End of the Road's\" 13-week record at number 1, by spending 14 weeks at the top of the chart (a feat equaled earlier that year by [[Whitney Houston]]'s cover of \"[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]]\"). \"On Bended Knee\" replaced \"I'll Make Love to You\" at number 1, making Boyz II Men only the third act ever to replace itself at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, after Elvis Presley and the Beatles.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>nnIn 1995, the group appeared as backing vocalists on \"[[HIStory (song)|HIStory]]\" from Michael Jackson's Grammy-nominated ninth [[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|album of the same name]].nn=== 1997u20131998: ''Evolution'' and label conflicts ===nMotown issued ''The Remix Collection'', a compilation of [[remix]]es of various Boyz II Men songs from ''Cooleyhighharmony'' and ''II''. The group itself had opposed the release of the collection because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as [[Uncle Sam (singer)|Uncle Sam]]), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by [[Epic Records]], not Motown.nnBoyz II Men's third studio album, ''[[Evolution (Boyz II Men album)|Evolution]]'', was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of ''II''{{'}}s ({{Nowrap|12 million}} copies) and ''Cooleyhighharmony'' ({{Nowrap|9 million}}). Only one of ''Evolution''{{'}}s singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \"[[4 Seasons of Loneliness|Four Seasons of Loneliness]]\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \"[[A Song for Mama]]\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'') was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \"Can't Let Her Go\" underperformed.nnThe global tour began in 1997 to promote ''Evolution'' was successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group. While on tour to support the ''Evolution'' album, Wanya Morris developed a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] on his [[vocal cords]], and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered. McCary's multiple sclerosis meant that he was unable to participate in most of the group's dance routines.nnBoyz II Men were nominated for 2 Grammys in 1998: Best R&B Album for ''Evolution'' and Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \"A Song for Mama\".nn=== 1999u20132001: ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' ===nIn 1999, Motown's parent company, [[PolyGram]], was bought by [[Universal Music Group]]. Amidst the major corporate restructure, Motown was merged with UMG's Universal Records, where Boyz II Men found themselves reassigned.nnTheir only studio LP album for Universal, 2000's ''[[Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya]]'', was chiefly written and produced by the group itself, in an attempt to update their sound and ward off critics who questioned the group's reliance on Babyface's hit-making songcraft. While the critics were more receptive to ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' than they had been to its predecessor, the LP sold only 500,000 copies in the US, {{Nowrap|1 million}} copies worldwide, and although its two singles, \"Pass You By\" and \"Thank You in Advance\" received media attention, neither became hits.nnBoyz II Men departed from Universal in 2001, ending their relationship with the company that brought them to international stardom in 1991. The label released a very successful [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''[[Legacy: The Greatest Hits Collection]]'', to close out their contract.nn=== 2002u20132003: ''Full Circle'' and \"The Color of Love\" ===nSigning a new deal with Arista Records in 2002, Boyz II Men began recording the ''[[Full Circle (Boyz II Men album)|Full Circle]]'' album, and recruited Babyface for a new single, \"The Color of Love\". In an attempt to recapture the massive success the group had enjoyed a decade earlier, the album received a significant promotional budget. Arista commissioned a high-budget music video, shot in four different locales by four different directors: supervising director [[Little X]] filmed scenes featuring Michael McCary in India, [[Hype Williams]] filmed Shawn Stockman in [[Tokyo]], [[Benny Boom]] filmed Nathan Morris in [[Ghana]], and [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]] filmed Wanya Morris in [[Puerto Rico]] and finally all were filmed in New York. The resulting music video had a debut on [[BET]], but failed to have a great effect, and ''Full Circle'', like ''Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya'' before it, sold slightly more than 500,000 copies in the US and {{Nowrap|1 million}} copies worldwide.nn''Full Circle'' became Boyz II Men's final album as a quartet, and their last effort to receive extensive promotion from a major record company. On {{Nowrap|January 30}}, 2003, Michael McCary left Boyz II Men due to chronic [[Human back|back]] problems resulting from [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) and personal problems. Arista terminated Boyz II Men's contract on {{Nowrap|April 30}}, and the remaining three members took a temporary hiatus from the music industry.nn=== 2004u20132006: ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' and ''The Remedy'' ===n[[File:Boyz II Men.jpg|thumb|left|Boyz II Men at the [[Genting Highlands]], [[Malaysia]] in 2007]]nAfter a year out of the spotlight, Boyz II Men created the independent label MSM Music Group (distributed through [[Koch Records]]), and released the ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' LP in 2004. The album is a collection of covers of classic R&B and soul songs such as [[The Dazz Band]]'s \"[[Let It Whip]]\", Michael Jackson's \"[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]\", and, as the single, [[Bobby Caldwell]]'s \"What You Won't Do for Love\". For this record, Nathan took on the bass lines as well as the baritone vocals that he sang when Boyz II Men was a quartet. ''Throwback, Vol. 1'' reached number 59 on the Billboard 200. The group launched an independent tour of North America and Asia in support of the ''Throwback'' series. The album sold over 200,000 copies with little to no promotion aside from the group's independent tour.nnIn 2005 Boyz II Men recorded a CD with Anderson Cameau called \"Apocalypse\", a project meant to benefit [[Haiti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/shows/a-very-soul-train-special/photos/2017/06/a-timeline-boyz-ii-men-career.html?cid=facebook|title=A Timeline: Boyz II Men's Career|website=BET.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>nnIn 2006, Boyz II Men's seventh studio album, ''The Remedy'', was released exclusively in Japan, where they found a thriving fan base.

Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1979, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl\", which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]]\", which Brown also co-led.nnDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|access-date=November 25, 2010|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition\". Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the membersu2014most prominently Tresvantu2014against the decision.nn=== Solo career ===nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]]\", but the album otherwise failed to perform well.nnBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the bestselling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step\".<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|date=November 23, 2020}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].nnIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/bobby-browns-cruel-beguiles-fans-but-not-the-cop-who-nabbed-him-for-dirty-dancing-vol-31-no-14/|title=Bobby Brown's Cruel Beguiles Fansu2014but Not the Cop Who Nabbed Him for Dirty Dancing|last1=Dougherty|first1=Steve|last2=Holmstrom|first2=Rick|date=April 10, 1989|website=People.com|language=EN}}</ref> In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day. In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.nnBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing erau2014one that Brown had dominatedu2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]]\", and \"Good Enough\". He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around\".<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]]\", which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.nnIn 1994 dance producers K-Klass remixed \"[[Two Can Play That Game (song)|Two Can Play That Game]]\" from the Bobby album, it would become Bobby's biggest single in the UK peaking at No.3 in 1995 and is seen as a 1990s dance classic and probably the single he is best remembered for in the UK.nnFour years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.nnPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']]\". Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''.nnIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4675-1944-1}}</ref>nnIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.nnIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year.

Born into a musical family in [[McComb, Mississippi]], Norwood was raised in [[Carson, California]], beginning her career as a [[backing vocalist]] for teen groups. After signing with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993, she released her [[Brandy (album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year, which sold six million copies worldwide. In 1996, Norwood began starring in the [[UPN]] sitcom ''[[Moesha]]'', created and written by [[Ralph Farquhar]], as the title character, which lasted six seasons and resulted in numerous other roles. She resumed her music career in 1998 with the wildly successful duet with fellow [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] contemporary [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], \"[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]\", which went on to become one of the best selling female duets of all time. Her second album, ''[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]'', featured two number one singles, and earned Norwood her first Grammy Award.nnThroughout the 2000s, Norwood held a precarious position in the pop industry. In 2002, she starred in the reality series ''[[Brandy: Special Delivery]]'', documenting the birth of her daughter. Her third and fourth albums, ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'' (2002) and ''[[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|Afrodisiac]]'' (2004), were released to critical success. She served as a judge on the [[America's Got Talent (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' before being involved in a widely publicized car accident in 2006. After several lawsuits stemming from the accident, Norwood's fifth album, ''[[Human (Brandy album)|Human]]'' (2008), was released to commercial failure.nnIn the 2010s, Norwood experienced a critical and commercial resurgence. In 2010, she returned to television as a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (American season 11)|eleventh season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and starred in the reality series ''[[Brandy & Ray J: A Family Business]]''. In 2012, she became a series regular in the [[BET]] series ''[[The Game (American TV series)|The Game]]'', and released her sixth album ''[[Two Eleven]]'' to critical praise. In April 2015, Norwood made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as [[Roxie Hart]] in the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. She starred in and executive produced a sitcom titled ''[[Zoe Ever After]]'' on BET which premiered in January 2016. In July 2020, Norwood released her seventh studio album, ''[[B7 (album)|B7]]'', also her first project as an independent artist, to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|first=Will|last=Lavin|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/brandy-b7-album-review-2720284?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=brandy-b7-album-review |title=Brandy u2013 'B7' review: illustrious R&B star shares hard-won truths on forthright comeback record |date=August 3, 2020 |publisher=[[NME]] |access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ratedrnb.com/2020/07/brandy-is-her-most-authentic-self-on-b7-album-review/|title=Brandy Is Her Most Authentic Self on 'B7': Album Review |first=Danielle|last=Brissett|work=RatedRnB|date=July 31, 2020|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brandy-interview-b7-cinderella-1036056/|title=With Her First Album in 8 Years, Brandy Finally Feels Free|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 31, 2020|access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"idolator\">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Weiss|title=Brandy Drops 'B7', Rolls Out \"Borderline\" Video|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|url=https://www.idolator.com/7913099/brandy-drops-b7-rolls-out-borderline-video?firefox=1|date=July 31, 2020|access-date=August 1, 2020}}</ref>nnAs of August 2020, she has sold over 40 million records worldwide, with approximately 8.62 million albums sold in the United States alone.<ref name=worldwide>{{cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/bet-experience/2018/bet-her-awards/brandy.html|title=BET Experience \"2018 BET Her Awards\" host Brandy Norwood noted selling 40 million records worldwide and over 11 million albums in the US.|publisher=BET.com|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Trust\">{{cite web|last=Trust|first=Gary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/267202/ask-billboard-how-popular-is-country-music|title=Ask Billboard: How Popular Is Country Music?|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=October 2, 2009|access-date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> Her work has earned her [[List of awards and nominations received by Brandy|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]], an [[American Music Award]], and seven [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]].

       <p>Music is an important part of the everyday life for most people. Whether it be music for a party, for the bus or the inescapable noice you hear in a telephone queue, it affects us in some way or another. But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? Are we exposing ourselves to positive or negative messages? Are we subconsciously choosing to listen to negative songs or postitive? And lastly how does the artists connect to one another, and what information can we derive from the different groupings? <br><br>\r\n\r\nThese are the questions we seek to answer in this study and to do just that we need some data. But to get these data, we first need to limit our search. There are quite frankly too many artists across the world for us to take them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess, so in order to make it manageble we chose to focus on only one particular genre of music. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p style="text-align: center">\r\n\r\n                <b>Hip Hop</b></p>\r\n            <p>\r\n\r\nWith it\'s rich history, interesting vocabulary and amazing artists we believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within this branch of music, as well as proving/disproving wether hip hop music is as violent/negative as people believe it to be.\r\n</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n      \r\n          <div class="row">\r\n        \r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 text-center"> <p></p><img src="img/data.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">\r\n        <div class="about-text">\r\n     \r\n\r\n          <h3>Dataset</h3>\r\n          <p>As mentioned, we are using the wikipedia list of important hip hop artists to limit the scope of artists in the hip hop genre. After that we are using the genius API to extract the necesary data and link the artists based on the collaborations they\'ve had on songs. We\'re using the amount of collaboration between two artists as the weight of the link, and we are adding five attributes to each node: Popularity, followers, twitter-handle, subgenre and instagram-name. Each artist also have as attributes the songs they\'ve made or collaborated on, and these songs have the attributes: hotness, pyongs, release date, page views, media platforms and title.<br>Read more about the dataset and the lyrics and attribute cleaning in the explainer notebook (link above)</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- Services Section -->\r\n<div id="network">\r\n  <div class="container">\r\n    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 section-title text-center">\r\n      <h2>Network</h2>\r\n      <hr>\r\n      <p>Using this information we created a graph consisting of 1062 nodes and \r\n12226 edges as seen below.

The concept is based on the fact that within any network there will be some groups of nodes that are more densely connected than others, this can in this case be caused by the fact that some artists are better friends with one another than others, or maybe because some artists are connected through their chosen genre. <br>\r\n                In the graph above 110 different communities were found, this number is of course also influenced by the amount of people who has no actual connection to the graph.<br>\r\n                We have decided to check if the artists are in fact connected through their subgenres. Below is twelwe pie charts that show the overall distribution of genres over the members of the six biggest communities. The first piechart includes the rap category, but since it takes up the majority of the chart we decided to omit it in the second version.<br><br>This means that for each community there are two pie charts, and the further down you look the smaller the communities.</p></div>\r\n              \r\n              \r\n              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                       <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n              \r\n                     <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    \r\n                     <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    \r\n                     <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR5.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR5.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    \r\n        \r\n                     <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieR6.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n             \r\n                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 followers">\r\n          <div class="portfolio-item1">\r\n            <div class="hover-bg text-center"> \r\n              <img src="img/PieNR6.png" class="img-responsive" alt="1NR">  \r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    \r\n    <p><br><br>\r\n              As it can be seen on the pie charts a lot of the artists have a majority of songs in the rap genre, This means that there is very little seperating the different communities in terms of the genres when rap is a part of it.

On the graph above it is possible to see the same communities as in the communities tab, but in this graph the nodes are scaled by how many followers each artist has.<br>\r\n                  In this plot we can see that we have a pink group that all have a lot of followers, considering their large node size.

For all the songs of each artist we took this information and for each node we saw which genre the artist had the most of and colored them acordingly. It is obvious that one color holds the majority, mainly rap, the dark green dots and pop, which is shown as pink.<br><br></p></div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div class="row">\r\n        \r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 service"> \r\n        <h3>Degree distribution linear axis</h3>\r\n        \r\n          <img src="img/DegreeLinear.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Degree distribution shown with linear scale">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 service"> \r\n        <h3>Degree distribution log log scale</h3>\r\n        \r\n          <img src="img/DegreeLogLog.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Degree distribution shown with log log axis">\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="row">\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 service"> \r\n      \r\n      <p>Above is two plots of the degree distribution. The degree distribution in this case describes the amount of unique people an artist have collaborated with. As it can be seen on the graph the degree distribution follows a power law distribution. This means that if an artist in the network is popular, then he or she is more likely to make new collaborations that others. This can be easily translated to the graph as more artist would have a desire to collaborate with more well known artists either to boost their own success through their followers, or simply because they would be more likely to have heard of a popular artist that matched a certain music style. This results in a distribution where a lot of the artist only have one or two connections, whilst popular artists can have up to 250 collaborations with.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="row">\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 service"> \r\n        <h3>Strength distribution</h3>\r\n        \r\n          <img src="img/StrengthLinear.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Strength distribution shown with linear scale">\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 service"> \r\n        <h3>Strength distribution log log</h3>\r\n        \r\n          <img src="img/StrengthLogLog.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Strength distribution shown with log log scale">\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="row">\r\n      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 service"> \r\n      \r\n      <p>Above is two plots of the strength distribution.

There are a lot of ways to group artists together such as the community method as seen above. Another way includes a specific centrality measure, mainly cliques. A clique is a group of artists where all the artists have connections to all other artists in the clique. If you were to move the slider beneath you would notice that both the value and the graph is changing. The value shows how big cliques we are looking for, if we have a value of three, and an artist is visible, then it means that the artist is a part of one or multiple three-artist-cliques where everyone is connected to oneanother. As the value reach fourteen you will see the names of the people in the largest clique.<br><br></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        <div class="""slidecontainer">\r\n  <input type="range" min="3" max="14" value="9" class="slider" id="myRange">\r\n  <p><br>Value: <b><span id="demo"></span></b></p>\r\n</div>\r\n          <img id="sliderimg" src="img/clique09.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Degree distribution shown with linear scale">\r\n          <p style="text-align: center"><br>Number of nodes in <span id="demo1"></span>-cliques: <b><span id="percentage"></span> / 1062</b></p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Based on these graphs we can conclude that even though a lot of nodes do not have a high degree, then they are still quite connected to the rest of the graph considering that 838/1062 of the nodes is in a 3-clique, and 646/1062 is in a 4-clique.

A simple look at how his name has changed during his career is enough to confirm this. We wanted to investigate if his language showed any sign of these transformations.<br>\r\n            On the figure below we see a colomn of words and a list of years. The orange dots indicate wether or not Snoop Dogg has said any of these things in his lyrics during those years.<br><br></p>\r\n\t\t<img src="img/snoopy.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Degree distribution shown with linear scale" style="width: 100%;\r\n\tborder-radius: 0px 0 0px 0;\r\n\tbox-shadow: 0px 0 #ff9900;">\r\n          <p><br>\r\n              As it can be seen on the figure above, the word "snoop" is said every single year since his career started, which really is not a surprise . However the word lion almost also appear each year, showing that he might have considered the idea of changing his name to Snoop Lion before he actually did it in 2012. <br>\r\nThe words "gangsta" is said in all years but one, and bitch is said in every year. This supports the stereotype that hip hop artists doesn\'t favor the nicest words. Even during 2012 when he declared that he was Bob Marley reincarnated, and wanted to turn his back on guns and violence, did he not stop using these words in his lyrics. However the plot doesn\'t mention how the words were mentioned.<br>\r\nThe last word that is linked to Snoop Dogg as a person is, "international\xe2\x80\x9d His use of this word loosely follows his transition to becoming an international star in the late 90\xe2\x80\x99s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have included some names that could be interesting to look at based on Snoop Doggs bio on Wikipedia. In the top, one can see Trump, who Snoop Dogg mentioned in various years and latest in 2017 when Trump became president. One can see as well that he has relations with fellow rappers Pharrell and Wiz Khalifa. The relation with Pharrell is an older relation, as Snoop released an album in 2002 featuring Pharrell. Snoop Dogg\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Wiz Khalifa is a very close, but does not go that far back in time, since Wiz Khalifa is newer on the stage and simply younger than Snoop Dogg (meaning that he would not have known him before later in his career). \r\n\r\n\r\n              <br><br> \r\n              The conclusion here is that the changes in his own demeanor and personality cannot be linked to these words at least, since Snoop Dogg tends to be using these words mostly through all the years.\r\n          </p>\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\t </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n    \r\n<!-- Portfolio Section -->\r\n<div id="contact">\r\n  <div class="container">\r\n    <div class="section-title text-center center">\r\n      <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>\r\n      <hr>\r\n      <p>A sentiment analysis is an analysis of wether a text is positive or negative.
